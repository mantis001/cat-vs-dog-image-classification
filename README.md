The Cats & Dogs is a foundational problem for a basic CNN(convolutional neural network) model which involves classifying images as a dog or a cat. It involves distinguishing between images of dogs and cats, making it an excellent dataset for learning how to develop, evaluate, and apply deep learning techniques for image classification. This includes designing a reliable test framework to assess model performance, experimenting with parameter adjustments to improve accuracy, and saving/loading the trained model to make predictions on new data.
